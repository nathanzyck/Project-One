Group of young kids caught me on my way into the store. Asked me if I wanted to make a bet.

I replied "I'm a gambling man"

Older kid said he could ride a wheelie on his bike stop sign to stop sign. I said no way.. and how much? He said $10. I said why $10? He said they wanted a large pizza at Dominos... I said deal.

The older kid began to ride his bike...


Sure enough he was able to do a wheelie on his bike. Not even wobbling at all. It was like there was a string on his front wheel to the sky. 

I got worried I'd actually have to pay him his money, especially when the kid looked back at me with a smile on his face. But then he hit the stop sign. 
I could hear the clang from where I was. 

Technically he did go from stop sign to stop sign on a wheelie, so I had to pay him his money.
