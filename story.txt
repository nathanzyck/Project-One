Group of young kids caught me on my way into the store. Asked me if I wanted to make a bet.

I replied "I'm a gambling man"

Older kid said he could ride a wheelie on his bike stop sign to stop sign. I said no way.. and how much? He said $10. I said why $10? He said they wanted a large pizza at Dominos... I said deal.

The older kid began to ride his bike...
