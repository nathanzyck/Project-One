Group of young kids caught me on my way into the store. Asked me if I wanted to make a bet.

I replied "I'm a gambling man"

Older kid said he could ride a wheelie on his bike stop sign to stop sign. I said no way.. and how much? He said $10. I said why $10? He said they wanted a large pizza at Dominos... I said deal.

The older kid began to ride his bike...


Sure enough he was able to do a wheelie on his bike. Not even wobbling at all. It was like there was a string on his front wheel to the sky. 

I got worried I'd actually have to pay him his money, especially when the kid looked back at me with a smile on his face. But then he hit the stop sign. 
I could hear the clang from where I was. 

Technically he did go from stop sign to stop sign on a wheelie, so I had to pay him his money.


"Double or nothing," I said. 
"You're on," the older kid, still rubbing his head, confidently replied. He wheeled his bike back to the first stop sign and cracked his knuckles.
"No way he does it again," "Are you serious? He's getting those 20 bucks!" the younger kids chattered amongst themselves.
Their leader set off again, front wheel airborne. I had to think of something quick. I picked up a rock from the ground. The kid was halfway to the other sign now. Discretely, I whipped the rock at the bikes rear wheel. Spokes getting caught on the foreign object, the kid was shot off the bike.
"Sorry kid, must've lost your balance."
